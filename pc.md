## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Its how we send and edit coding weve changed/edited on our own computers to a repo for others to access.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git its the code used to send the code and GitHub is where code from all sources is stored to pull from
3. Why do we create a branch?
so that you can change and test code before changing the main code. incase something goes wrong you havent lost the previous working code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
to talk about changes and check them before adding it to the main on github
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git switch ()
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch just checks if there is anything new on the remote repo, git merge takes your branches and merges it back to the original, and git pull checks and then takes the changes from the remote to your local.
7. What is a merge conflict?
git cant resolve the differences in code between two commits, usually happens when people work on the same file and edit the same lines or someone deleted the file youre working on
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
find the merge conflict and choose which branch's edit you want, or if you want to combine them, and then do a new commit with the update. if the file got deleted then go in and add that file back then commit.
